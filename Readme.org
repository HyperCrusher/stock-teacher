* *Stock Teacher*

Stock Teacher is a web application designed to make learning about the stock market accessible and fun for kids.
It replaces abstract concepts with a hands-on game, allowing parents and educators to teach financial literacy using real-world stock data.

** How It Works
The game is structured around a simple, interactive experience for both the game organizer and the players.

*** 1. Game Setup

A parent or educator acts as the "Game Master" and sets up a new game:
- **Define Players:** Add one or more players (e.g., their children or students).
- **Set a Timeframe:** Choose how long the game will run (e.g., 4 weeks, 90 days).
- **Pick Stocks:** For each player, select initial stocks and define a starting virtual investment amount.

Once the game is created, the Game Master receives a management link and unique links for each player.

*** 2. Player Experience

Players use their unique links to access a personal dashboard where they can:
- Track their virtual portfolio's value in near real-time.
- See how their individual stock picks are performing.
- Get a clear, visual representation of their gains or losses over time.

*** 3. Automated Report Cards

To foster ongoing learning and engagement, Stock Teacher automatically generates report cards:
- **Weekly Updates:** At the end of each week, players receive a report card summarizing their portfolio's performance, highlighting what went up or down and why.
- **Final Results:** At the conclusion of the game, a final report card is issued, showing the total increase or decrease in value and providing a complete summary of their investment journey.

** Technology Stack

- **Backend:** A custom, lightweight web server built with **Rust** using the **Warp** framework and a **SQLite** database.
- **Frontend:** A multi-page application built with **SolidJS**.
